# Project Definition

A website acts as a fantasy football clone for baseball but only home runs. Would only be for my friends so not big.

Needs to be able to host a draft before the season. Log in needed

A season long battle so weekly games don't exist. Therefore it is mainly just for checking in on the current homerun totals during the season.


## Starting the server
Run `nodemon ./backend/server.js` to start the server up and have auto updates. Just use `npm ./backend/server.js` for an actual server.

## Using postgres and docker
[Postgres Guide](https://postgres.guide/)
Use version 16 as there was a version issue with 18.


## API
Using the MLB api from this hackathon they put on.
